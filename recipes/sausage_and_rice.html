        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. 
                Add sausage; cook about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned. 
                Add broccoli and bell pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, 
                until broccoli is bright green and slightly tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove mixture to a plate. </li>
            <li>
                Carefully wipe the hot skillet clean, reduce heat to medium, and add 1 tablespoon oil. 
                Add eggs; cook, stirring once or twice, until set, 2 to 3 minutes. 
                Transfer to a cutting board and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. </li>
            <li>
                Return the skillet to medium-high heat. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add cauliflower; cook, 
                undisturbed, until softened and lightly toasted, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. </li>
            <li>
                Stir in soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, pepper, sausage mixture, and egg. 
                Divide among plates and top with cilantro. </li>
